## The application consists of several key files:

- index.js - Main application entry point
- resortAnalyzer.js - AI-powered resort analysis
- snowAnalyzer.js - Snow conditions analysis
- mockData.js - Test data
- index.ejs - Frontend template

Let's examine each component in detail:

AI-Powered Resort Analysis (resortAnalyzer.js) The core intelligence of the application lies in the resortAnalyzer.js file. Here's how it works:

a. **Integration with Gemini AI:**

The application uses Google's Gemini AI model (specifically 'models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest') for intelligent analysis.

```javascript
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
```

b. **Data Processing:**
```javascript
const snowDaysCount = weatherData.daily.filter(day => day.snow > 0).length;
const totalSnowfall = weatherData.daily.reduce((sum, day) => sum + (day.snow || 0), 0);
const avgTemp = weatherData.daily.reduce((sum, day) => sum + day.temp.day, 0) / weatherData.daily.length;
```

Calculates key metrics from weather data. Tracks snow days, total snowfall, and average temperature

c. **Structured Prompt System: The AI analysis is guided by a carefully structured prompt with four main sections:**

- SNOW CONDITIONS: Analyzes current and expected snow conditions
- BEST DAYS: Identifies optimal skiing days
- RESORT CHOICE: Evaluates skiing conditions and provides alternatives
- SKIER ADVICE: Provides equipment and safety recommendations

d. **Response Processing:**
```javascript
const sections = {
  conditions: (analysis.match(/# SNOW CONDITIONS\n([\s\S]*?)(?=# BEST DAYS|$)/) || [])[1] || '',
  bestDays: (analysis.match(/# BEST DAYS\n([\s\S]*?)(?=# RESORT CHOICE|$)/) || [])[1] || '',
  alternatives: (analysis.match(/# RESORT CHOICE\n([\s\S]*?)(?=# SKIER ADVICE|$)/) || [])[1] || '',
  advice: (analysis.match(/# SKIER ADVICE\n([\s\S]*?)(?=$)/) || [])[1] || ''
};
```

- Uses regex patterns to extract structured sections from AI response
- Cleans up formatting and removes artifacts
- Provides fallback messages for empty section

**Let's look at the frontend template:**

Read index.ejs, lines 1 to 21

## Frontend Implementation 

The frontend is built with EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating) and provides:
- A clean, responsive interface
- Sections for displaying weather data and AI analysis
- Error handling and loading states
- Data Flow The application works in this sequence:

1. User selects a ski resort
2. Weather data is fetched (likely from OpenWeatherMap API)
3. Weather data is processed by snowAnalyzer.js
4. Processed data is sent to Gemini AI through resortAnalyzer.js
5. AI generates structured analysis
6. Analysis is parsed and formatted
7. Results are displayed in the EJS template

## Key Features

- Intelligent snow condition analysis
- Weather data processing and interpretation
- Multi-day forecast analysis
- Alternative resort recommendations
- Safety and equipment advice
- Fallback handling for missing data
- Comprehensive error logging

**Error Handling and Validation:**

```javascript
const hasAllSections = Object.values(sections).every(section => section.length > 0);
if (!hasAllSections) {
  console.warn('Missing sections in AI response:', {
    hasConditions: sections.conditions.length > 0,
    hasBestDays: sections.bestDays.length > 0,
    hasAlternatives: sections.alternatives.length > 0,
    hasAdvice: sections.advice.length > 0
  });
}
```

- Validates AI responses
- Provides fallback content
- Logs issues for debugging

## Recent Improvements

- Enhanced prompt structure for more consistent AI responses
- Improved handling of cases where no alternative resorts are available
- Better section parsing with regex patterns
- Added fallback content for empty sections
- Improved error logging and debugging capabilities

## The application demonstrates effective integration of:

- AI technology (Google's Gemini)
- Weather data processing
- Natural language generation
- User interface design
- Error handling and validation

This creates a robust system for providing ski resort recommendations based on current conditions and forecasts, with intelligent analysis that adapts to varying conditions and available alternatives.
